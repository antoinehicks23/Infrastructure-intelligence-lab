# Infrastructure Intelligence Lab

This repository documents my ongoing work in predictive maintenance, reliability modeling, and infrastructure-focused system simulations using Python.

## Focus Areas

- Engine room maintenance log analysis
- Failure pattern classification
- Downtime aggregation and risk scoring
- Financial system simulations for capital allocation discipline

## Current Projects

- Loan payoff simulation tool
- Engine room maintenance analyzer (v1 in development)

## Long-Term Direction

Developing AI-driven reliability tools for critical infrastructure systems, with a long-term focus on power systems engineering and predictive maintenance.

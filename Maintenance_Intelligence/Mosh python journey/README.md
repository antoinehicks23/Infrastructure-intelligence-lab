# Python Learning Lab
### My documented journey through the Mosh Python Mega Course

## Purpose

This repo is my public learning log as I build Python foundations 
toward backend engineering for infrastructure intelligence systems.
Every file represents a concept I worked through, understood, 
and committed to muscle memory.

## Why I'm Building This

I'm a Navy engineer transitioning into Electrical Engineering 
with a focus on power systems and infrastructure reliability. 
Python is the backbone of the AI-driven maintenance intelligence 
software I'm building toward. This repo documents where I started.
